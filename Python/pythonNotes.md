1. **`sys.stdout.write()` vs. `print()`**. While `print(obj)` has become a function in Python 3.x, it calls `sys.stdout.write(obj+'\n')` for the most of the time. I personally regard `sys.stdout.write()` something like `printf()` function in C language. With `sys.stdout.write()` you can achieve more like [displaying progress](https://github.com/FeiYao-Edinburgh/Shell-Python-Advanced/blob/master/Scripts/sys_stdout_write.py).
2. Determine the location of a package by printing the package's \_\_file\_\_ attribute, e.g. `import minisom; print(minisom.__file__)`, then we can change the original codes if applicable.
3. In Python 3, taking quotient and remainder has become `//` and `%`. `/` will always return numbers with decimals.
4. `try/except/else/finally` in Python 3. This [link](https://www.cnblogs.com/windlazio/archive/2013/01/24/2874417.html) greatly explains the logical sequence of `try/except/else/finally`. We can also use `raise` statement to raise an error mandatorily so as to achieve some of the effects that we want. Note that `raise` must be followed by an `Exception` class, for convenience, we can just use `Exception`. See [my script](https://github.com/FeiYao-Edinburgh/Shell-Python-Advanced/blob/master/Scripts/try_except_else_finally_raise.py) for more details.
5. `with` in Python 3.
