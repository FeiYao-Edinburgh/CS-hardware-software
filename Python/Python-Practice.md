### Question 1
- Description: Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
- Hint: Consider use for loop. `','.join(['a','b'])` will produce `a,b`

### Question 2
- Description: Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given number.<br/>
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8<br/>
Then, the output should be: 40320
- Hint: Consider use for loop. Better to define a function.

### Question 3
- Description: With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i\*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included) and then the program should print the dictionary.<br/>
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8<br/>
Then, the output should be: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
- Hint: Consider use for loop and dict.

### Question 4
- Description: Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.<br/>
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 34,67,55,33,12,98<br/>
Then, the output should be: ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98'], ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
- Hint: `input()` is the function to receive values typed from the console.
