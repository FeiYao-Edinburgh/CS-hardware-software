# Introduction to Modern Fortran for Earth System Sciences

### Errata
- p.26, `print '(i3)', id` -> `print '(i3.3), id'`
- p.30, `deffered` -> `deferred`
- p.53, `forming` -> `performing`?
- p.88, would it be great to change `if they are initialized in the subroutine` to `if they are initialized in the declaration part in the subroutine`?
- 

### Questions
- p.43, would it be great if giving `Re` and change `λ{E,W}` -> `λ{S,N}`, `Φ{S,N}` -> `Φ{E,W}`?
- p.66, `this intrisic function` denotes `allocate()`?
- p.95, Not sure why only 3.2.7.1?
- p.100, where to put "or external procedures with an interface block"?
  - refer to p.94 before `type` or refer to p.104 after `end type`?
