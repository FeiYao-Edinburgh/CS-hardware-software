### Fortran Compilation with NetCDF
Simple programs using the [NetCDF-Fortran](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs-fortran/) can be downloaded from [here](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/examples/programs/). I have gone through all Fortran 90 program examples and made some more comments as follows and revisions (upload them to the NetCDF directory) for more discussion.

**1. Compilation tips.** When compiling, the computer might complain that `Fatal error: can't open module file 'netcdf.mod' for reading at <1>: no such file or directory`. In this case, we need to [tell the program the path of 'netcdf.mod'](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/support/help/MailArchives/netcdf/msg09593.html) by using `-I` and `-l` parameters. They are further explained by searching the `gfortran` detailed help with `gfortran -v --help | less`.
```
  -l LIBNAME, --library LIBNAME
                              Search for library LIBNAME
  -I DIR                  add DIR to search list for .include directives
```
To locate the path of 'netcdf.mod', we can use `find` command like `find /usr/ -type f -name netcdf.mod`. After all of these, we can compile the program using `gfortran simple_xy_wr.f90 -o simple_xy_wr -I/usr/lib64/gfortran/modules/ -lnetcdff`.

**2. Array indexing, shape, and storing clarifications.** In standard, a mxn grid A is indexed by A(x,y) where x indicates row number and y indicates column number, hence the shape is mxn. A is stored by column-major format, namely A(1,1), A(2,1), A(3,1), ..., A(m,1), A(1,2), A(2,2), A(3,2), ..., A(m,2), ..., A(1,n), A(2,n), A(3,n), ..., A(m,n). **In NetCDF-Fortran, a mxn grid A is indexed by A(y,x) where y indicates column number and x indicates row number, hence the shape is nxm**. To make things easier, ***just look the array in NetCDF-Fortran by following the second -> first order in indexing and shape but bear in mind that the real array is still nxm shape and first -> second indexing***. To conclude, if we want to define a 6x12 grid, we define a 12x6 array data_out whose values can be copied from transpose(6x12 grid), we then define a NetCDF variable called data whose dimension is 12x6 (e.g. (/ y_dimid, x_dimid /) in simple_xy_wr.f90), we finally insert the data_out array into the variable data (i.e. ***the column-connetced values of data_out or the row-connected values of the 6x12 grid are inserted into the data variable row by row or the data variable array column by column (column is the first index indicating row in real array)***, because the first dimension of the data variable is column, which changes fastest and hence is the inner loop). In a later time, we read the NetCDF variable data back to an array data_in in Fortran, note that it is still 12x6 array with column first indexed (i.e. simple_xy_rd.f90). Nevertheless, if we use ncdump or xarray to read it becomes 6x12 grid with row first indexed as we wanted. (NB ***contents*** are principals and corresponding examples.) I suppose N-D array has the same logic as I saw that [one example](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs-fortran/f90-variables.html#f90-create-a-variable-nf90_def_var) in the NetCDF-Fortran official document defines a 3-D array (time x lat x lon) by using a reversed order for dimids, i.e. `(/ londimid, latdimid, timedimid /)`.
