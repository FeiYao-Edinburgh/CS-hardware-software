This repository mainly contain notes that I further enhance my programming capabilities including Shell, Python, Fortran, Perl, and etc. It will also contain some notes on computer hardware knowledge, which is surely beneficial for deeply understanding the essence of programming. Moreover, it might also contain some notes on math as math is always the foundation of many algorithms.

### VERY useful short-cuts in Bash, Vim, and etc.
#### Bash
1. Ctrl-w: deletes word by word backward.
2. Ctrl-u: deletes from the beginning to the position of the cursor of the line.
3. Ctrl-k: deletes from the position of the cursor to the end of the line
4. Ctrl-y: to paste the deleted/cutted lines from 1, 2, and 3.
5. Ctrl-left-arrow (or Alt-b): moves cursor back one word.
6. Ctrl-right-arrow (or Alt-c): moves cursor forward one word.
7. Ctrl-a: moves cursor back the beginning of the line.
8. Ctrl-e: moves cursor to the end of the line.
9. Ctrl-r: Searching the history.
10. Shift-PgUp: pge scroll up.
11. Shift-PgDn: pge scroll down.
12. Shift-up-arrow: line scroll up.

14. When within `tmux`, using Ctrl-b-\[ to enter scroll mode and then PgUp/PgDn/Up-arrow/Down-arrow should work fine as in Vim.
