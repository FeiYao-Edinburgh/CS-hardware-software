This repository mainly collects learning resources for a range of programming languages. Rules of Thumb include:
- If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders on giants. -Isaac Newton
- If I have seen further, it it by importing from the code of giants. -Definitely Not Isaac Newton
- For day-to-day science exploration, speed of development is primary, and speed of execution is often secondary.
- Open code, better science!
