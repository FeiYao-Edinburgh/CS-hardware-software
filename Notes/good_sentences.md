### Good sentences to remember (NB These will be hopefully moved my new personal website in the future)
1. Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. (Albert Einstein)
2. Premature optimization is the root of all evil. (Donald Knuth)
3. One guiding principal of Python/Fortran code is that "explicit is better than implicit".
4. Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare. (有些人浅薄，有些人金玉其外，而败絮其中，有天你会遇到一个彩虹般绚丽的人，当你遇到这个人后，会觉着其他人只是浮云而已)
5. Have an Octotastic day!
6. Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
